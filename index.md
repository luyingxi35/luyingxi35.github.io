## About Me
I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Prior to this, I was a member of the <span style="color:darkred"><strong>China National Physics Olympiad Training Team</strong></span>.

In terms of academic performance, my average GPA is 3.81/4.00, which places me within the <span style="color:darkred"><strong>top 50%</strong></span> of my class. I have been conducting research under the supervision of Professor [Yi Li](https://ericyi.github.io/) since my sophomore year. Currently, I am pursuing research in <span style="color:darkred"><strong>robotics</strong></span>.

Outside of research, I enjoy <span style="color:darkred"><strong>🏊‍♂️ swimming, ⚾ softball, 🏸 badminton, 🎤 singing, 📖 reading</strong></span>, and <span style="color:darkred"><strong>🌍 traveling</strong></span>. Next semester, I plan to start learning <span style="color:darkred"><strong>🎾 tennis</strong></span> and <span style="color:darkred"><strong>🇫🇷 French.</strong></span> I truly value meaningful conversations and collaborations—if you share similar interests or would like to connect on research or beyond, I would be delighted to hear from you!✨

## Research Interests
My research interests include: 
- **Robotics:** Robot learning and control; Contact-rich and deformable object manipulation; Reinforcement learning.
- **Multi-modal LLMs:** Reasoning with multi-modal LLMs.

Currently, I am particularly interested in <span style="color:darkred"><strong>robotics</strong></span>, and I have been devoted to exploring and improving the <span style="color:darkred"><strong>scaling laws of synthetic data</strong></span> for robot learning.
